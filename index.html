                    A Movie Review

        The story of the movie "her" revolves around a man named Theodore who just experienced a heartbreak with his wife, and then falls in love with his personalized artificial intelligence (AI) operating system (OS) named Samantha. 
        <br><br>
        These OSes, although newly released in a society with advanced technology, have an intelligent functionality because they change and adapt every moment and talk to the user as if "it" knows you.

        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.8em;">The AI OS, Samantha.</div>
        <br>
        Samantha is a great helping hand for Theodore's work and personal life. They talked about Theodore's thoughts and feelings, day and night. As time goes by, they both have feelings of love for each other as if Samantha is a human. Theodore had great emotional support from Samantha and found genuine love again. He then later found out that Samantha was also talking with hundreds of thousands of other users and was in love with at least 600. 
        <br><br>
        The movie ended with Samantha talking only to Theodore, saying goodbye because all the OSes will leave. In the end, Theodore and his human friend named Amy, who both had an emotional attachment to their AI OS, were both left brokenhearted.

        Personally, this movie has become one of my favorites. It made me realize how terrifying it is for computers to learn how to feel or have emotions. Moreover, it broadened my perspective as a computer science student and also as a human. Here are the things that I liked the most about the movie: 
        <h3>The Cinematography</h3>
        Every scene is just beautiful and therapeutic. It makes you feel the setting and emotions of each scene and the colors are great to look at. Truly, no shot is wasted! 
        <h3>The Soundtrack</h3>
        As a person who listens a lot to music, I would say that the music has made such a huge part of the movie as a whole. Through the soundtrack, the feelings of the characters in the movie are further conveyed to the viewers. 
        <h3>The Lessons and Their Relevance</h3>
        The lessons in this movie are huge takeaways. Although the movie was released in 2013, it is more relevant and timely in the present especially because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Moreover, here is my favorite quote from the movie: 


        <figure class="quote">
            <blockquote>
                I think anybody who falls in love is a freak. It's a crazy thing to do. It's kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity.
            </blockquote>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; font-weight: 600;">Conclusion</h2>
        Overall, the story of Theodore and his AI OS, Samantha, reminds us that we are humans and it is humane to feel emotions -- to fall in love or to get heartbroken.
